### Manuscript title: _Anomalous protein-protein interactions in multivalent salt solution_

By clicking here: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mlund/si-proteins_in_multivalent_electrolyte)
the Jupyter Notebook can be run interactively in a browser and plots can be reproduced. Note that we provide saved Monte Carlo simulation data so that no production needs to be run, nor is it needed to compile the MC package although this is fully possible from within the notebook.

The layout is as follows

- `gmx/` Gromacs input files for all-atom simulations of HSA
- `mc/` Metropolis Monte Carlo program and simulation output
- `pmf.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for protein-protein potential of mean force using Metropolis MC
